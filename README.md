# A Clone of [Google Forms Landing Page](https://www.google.com/forms/about/)

This repo contains a fully responsive html document written from scratch using _Tailwindcss framework_,
keeping in mind the different viewports across a variety of devices.

## Usage
Just clone the repo and open the `index.html` file in a browser (chrome and firefox recommended), and rest should happen automatically.

## Note
The images and backgrounds are **live links** taken from the actual Google forms website, so to view them an active
internet connection is required.
